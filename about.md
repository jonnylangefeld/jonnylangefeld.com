<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 40px; margin-top: -50px">About</h1>

<div>
  <p>I am a data enthusiast and end-to-end developer of complex, Cloud-Native, global software solutions in an environment of backend engineering, robotics & Big Data. My interdisciplinary skill set reaches from software development to dev-ops to data science and machine learning. In my current role at <a href="https://getcruise.com">Cruise</a>, I am helping to shape the future by building autonomous driving software, developer productivity tools, infrastructure APIs and automation. My previous hands-on experience in global teams with IBM and Mercedes-Benz is built upon numerous projects to build data-driven products, high throughput APIs and collection, storage, preparation and analysis of data to make valuable predictions and support decisions.
  </p>

  <p>Many of my skills are self-taught on evenings and weekends. The internet has taught me about the command line, building websites, building RESTful and gRPC APIs, <a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld">getting comfortable with git</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/ChordPro">writing programs with Python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/SPSSTwitter">creating free Add-on nodes for SPSS Modeler</a> and <a h href="https://www.kaggle.com/jonnylangefeld/explore-dividends">analyzing data with pandas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/learning/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/scikit-learn%20Classifier.ipynb">skikit learn and numpy</a>. I read everything about Docker on a beach in Cuba with an app that allowed me to download websites. Ever since I have been a heavy user of the software and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JprTjTViaEA">teach others how to use it.</a> That again helped me to get into the Cloud-Native space and I learned everything about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Ynjl_JIm0">Kubernetes</a> and Helm. I have written multiple production ready <a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/datadog-operator">kubernetes controllers and operators</a> and created an maintain a <a href="https://github.com/jonnylangefeld/kubectl-mc">Kubernetes CLI plugin</a> to manage multiple clusters at once, which is used by engineers across many companies. I constantly try to further educate myself. (All links lead to examples of my work).</p>

  <p><b>University</b></p>

  <p>I graduated with a B.Sc. in business information technology from the <a href="http://www.dhbw.de/english/home.html" target="_blank">Cooperative State University Stuttgart</a> in Germany.</p>

  <p><b>Projects</b></p>

  <p>I have worked on a great variety of projects in various roles. They all were data driven and software development centric. I have been a data science consultant with IBM for many large corporations like Daimler, Continental, Porsche, Bosch, Fiducia. I have been a software developer with Mercedes, my startup energy-smart, Cruise, as well as for open-source software. I worked as a backend engineer for Mercedes-Benz and Cruise in Silicon Valley. For all details of the projects publicly available, head over to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonnylangefeld/" target="_blank">Linked In page</a>, where I keep an up-to-date list of my projects.</p>
