Welcome! You found me online! 
This is my first post on my personal website, on which I post things I'm interested in. I will use this space for thoughts, ideas, experiences and dreams. 
My name is Jonathan Langefeld, but almost everybody calls me Jonny. My mum used to call me Jonny from a young age and it stated in 6th grade, when a teacher picked up my nickname, that everybody started calling me Jonny.    
I live in Silicon Valley where I am persuing a professional carrier as computer scientist. Over the years I gained a broad skillset that reaches from software development over project management all the way to data science and machine learning. If you want to learn more about me, head over to the [about page](/about) or check out my [resumé](/assets/about/Resumé Jonathan Langefeld.pdf).

### What you can expect:

I love talking about all kinds of topic and am generally interested in what you have to say. If you let me choose the topic though, it will mainly circle around finance, business and entrepreneurship or computer science. This can long from the stock market, investing, retirment savings, real estate, passive income, dividends, cryptocurrencies, statups, company histories, small businesses, digital nomadism all the way to software development, coding challenges, docker, python, web development, machine learning, data science, deep learning. I love to combine those topics, hence I am very interested in young fintechs and digital payments/stores of value.    
If you have any question, feel free to reach out to me through one of my social media channels or via the [contact form](/about).
